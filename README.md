## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![image_name](Deliverable1_screenshot.png)

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Variables "vehicle_length" and "ground_clearance" provide a non-random amount of variance considering the p values are much lower than the other variables (2.6e^-12 and 5.21e^-8). 

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- No it is not considered to be zero. Considering the p-value (5.35e^-11 is way below 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis 

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- the R-Squared value is 0.7149 for this dataset, which means it has an efficacy of prediction of ~71.49%. This implies that the linear model effectively predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
